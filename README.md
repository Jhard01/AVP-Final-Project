# Drum Synthesis and Sequencing Project

## Video - https://youtu.be/KcEzhWzLQ4Q

A project demonstrating different synthesis techniques to create drum sounds using ofxMaxim and ofxGui.

## Description

This project explores a range of different synthesis techniques. It is comprised of a 16 step sequencer (See Acknowledgement) that allows the user to choose on or off states for each sound. The sounds are as follows: Kick drum, Snare Drum, Closed Hi Hat, Open Hi Hat, Cow Bell, Tom Drum, and Cymbal. The rough sounds were generated in Ableton live beforehand allowing me to prototype each sound individually. That knowledge was then transferred to openFrameworks using the ofxMaxim library. There are a few parameters that are tweakable through the GUI. They allow the user to change the timer speed and global pitch of all the sounds. The global pitch is a feature I wanted to create drum patterns; It is a feature that I've only really seen in Fruity Loops. In the demonstration video, I show the versatility of the sounds the drum machine can create spanning a range of styles and tempos. As an extension of this project, I would like to implement a GUI that allows the user to tweak the individual parameters of each drum sound. The synthesis techniques used are Frequency modulation, subtractive and additive. They were all implemented to create sounds of different timbral qualities.
